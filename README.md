## Calculate the range of a projectile

This is the first project according the [Physics Simulation Manual](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/javamanual.pdf) by Daniel V. Shroeder, ver. 2.4 08/2011.
We neglect air resistance and use the elementary formula to calculate the range of the projectile. This is also an introduction to the Java language.
